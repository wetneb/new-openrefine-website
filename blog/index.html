many ways, and we are looking for help in this front.
We are looking for proposals from prospective contractors to improve the install experience of OpenRefine on MacOS and/or Windows.
After a similar effort on Ubuntu/Debian packaging, this initiative is meant to improve the user experience on other platforms, to lower the install barrier for a broader audience.

After the move, we will not delete the mailing lists, but  keep them read-only as a public archive. We feel inspired to move  forward to this, because in <a href="https://openrefine.org/blog/2022/06/28/2022-survey-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our latest user survey (held in April-May 2022)</a>, a web-based forum was the most popular option when we asked you for your preferred means of communications.</p><p>Our choice would be a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted web-based Discourse forum</a>, on a URL like forum.openrefine.org or similar. We would go for  Discourse for many reasons. First, because it is well-designed and  widely used open source forum software, but (among other things) also  because it allows much more diverse discussion on &#x27;smaller&#x27; topics (e.g. translation of OpenRefine&#x27;s interface; discussion about larger feature  requests; threads in languages other than English...). Discourse offers  mailing list / email modes for people who prefer this as their main mode of communications.</p><p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PY0T6dudVO6iQAbf1EUEdL1UTHu7eSFamJjL22ELMEI/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We collected many considerations and pros/cons in this document, including the other options we could consider.</a></strong> We invite your comments and feedback <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PY0T6dudVO6iQAbf1EUEdL1UTHu7eSFamJjL22ELMEI/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there</a>, or on OpenRefine&#x27;s mailing list.

Our fifth edition was live in April-May 2022. No less than 207 people participated, which  breaks our record of 2020 when we received 178 responses.</p><p>This year&#x27;s survey was a bit more extensive than the previous ones (in <a href="http://googlerefine.blogspot.ca/2012/10/google-refine-usage-survey-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012</a>, <a href="http://openrefine.org/blog/2014/08/29/2014-survey-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014</a>, <a href="http://openrefine.org/blog/2018/07/16/2018-survey-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018</a> and <a href="https://openrefine.org/blog/2020/02/20/2020-survey-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020</a>); we now also included questions related to support and communications in the community. For the first time, we also asked you to give the software a general score. On average, survey respondents gave OpenRefine a solid 8 out of 10!

This year, we very proactively reached out to many of OpenRefine&#x27;s typical user communities; this has resulted in a more &#x27;even&#x27; distribution of sectors and communities that our survey respondents hailed from. Based on new popular answers in previous surveys, we added a few extra options to the question &quot;Which field(s), discipline(s) or community/ies do you most identify with?&quot; and respondents could provide more than one answer. Today, librarians are still the largest group of OpenRefine users (15.1%), followed by cultural sector professionals (11.6%), Linked Open Data / semantic web aficionadas (11.2%), researchers (10.1%) and data scientists (9.5%).</p><a href="https://raw.github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2022survey/2022-survey-communities.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.github.com/master/images/2022survey/2022-survey-communities.png" class="inset" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The vast majority of people use OpenRefine professionally, but 14.9% of our users do indicate that they mainly use the software in their free time.

Quite a few OpenRefine users will be familiar with <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikidata</a>, the multilingual Linked Open Data knowledge base of the Wikimedia movement. Since 2019, media files (digital photographs, videos, sound files, etc) on Wikimedia Commons, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can also be described with multilingual linked data from Wikidata</a>.</p><p>OpenRefine already includes support for Wikidata and, more recently, arbitrary Wikibases.
